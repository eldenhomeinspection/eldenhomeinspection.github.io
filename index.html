    <h2>The MA Board of Registration of Home Inspectors recommends you attend the inspection</h2>
    <p>This allows the buyer to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observe the inspector</li>
      <li>Ask the inspector questions directly</li>
      <li>Obtain a better understanding of the condition of the home</li>
      <li>Learn how the systems of the home work, and how to maintain those systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The written report may be easier to understand if the buyer was present
      during the inspection.
    </p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the home inspection, the buyer should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be well informed of the condition of the home</li>
      <li>Know if there are visible, apparent problems</li>
      <li>Know if repairsÂ  are required</li>
      <li>Know whether or not there are any risks of concealed damage</li>
      <li>Know whether further investigation is recommended or required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Closer Look at Fall Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to home maintenance and what should be done during which season,
      most homeowners find that spring is the time to assess winter damage,
      start repairs and prepare for warmer months.
